# Seed Studio: Your Digital Gardening Companion

Welcome to Seed Studio, a comprehensive application designed to help you manage every aspect of your gardening hobby. From tracking your seed inventory to logging your daily activities and celebrating your harvests, Seed Studio is the perfect tool to help you grow a successful garden.

This application is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and it uses your browser's local storage to save all your data, ensuring your information is private and stored directly on your device.

## Core Features

### 1. Dashboard
The central hub of your gardening world. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview of your garden's status:
- **Inventory Summary:** See how many seed varieties you have and get alerts for low-stock items.
- **Next Task:** Stay on top of your schedule with a quick look at the next recurring task.
- **Recent Harvest Chart:** Visualize the yield of your garden with a chart summarizing your recent harvests by weight.
- **Recent Activity Chart:** Track your gardening activities over the last 30 days to see where you're investing your efforts.

### 2. Inventory Management
A powerful system for organizing your seed collection.
- **Track Key Details:** For each seed, you can record its name, source, planting instructions, germination time, and more.
- **Packet & Seed Count:** Log both the number of packets and the approximate number of seeds per packet for a precise inventory.
- **Advanced Tagging:** Organize your seeds with custom tags. A pop-up tag manager allows you to create new tags or select from a dynamic, searchable list of over 100 predefined suggestions.
- **Filtering & Search:** Use the powerful filter and search tools to quickly find what you need by name, source, or tags.
- **Wishlist:** Keep a separate list of seeds you want to buy or acquire in the future.
- **Seed Viability:** Input the purchase year for your seeds, and the app will automatically flag older packets that may have lower germination rates.

### 3. Garden Journal
Your personal garden diary.
- **Rich Entries:** Create beautiful journal entries with a title, date, notes, and a gallery of multiple photos to document your garden's progress.
- **Visual History:** Look back at your photos and notes to remember what worked, what didn't, and how your garden has evolved over the seasons.

### 4. Activity Logs
Keep a detailed record of every task you perform in the garden.
- **Log Everything:** Track activities like planting, watering, pruning, pest control, and harvesting.
- **Add Details:** Each log can include specific notes, a photo, and the associated seed.
- **Harvest Tracking:** When logging a harvest, you can record the `weight` and `quantity` of your yield, which feeds directly into the Dashboard charts.

### 5. Task Scheduler
Stay organized and never miss a task with the recurring schedule.
- **Create Recurring Tasks:** Set up daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly reminders for essential activities like watering or fertilizing.
- **Overdue Alerts:** The app automatically highlights tasks that are overdue based on your last logged activity, ensuring your plants get the consistent care they need.

### 6. Settings
Customize the application to fit your needs.
- **Theme Control:** Switch between light and dark modes.
- **Custom Tasks:** Create your own task types to match your unique gardening workflow.
- **Data Management:** Export all your application data (inventory, logs, journal, etc.) to a single JSON file for backup. You can also import a backup file to restore your data.
